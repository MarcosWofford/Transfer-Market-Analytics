# Transfer-Market-Analytics
This project focuses on web scraping detailed information about soccer players, including performance statistics, positions, team history, and past transfer prices. The data will be organized in a structured database and analyzed to identify patterns that can be used to create predictions for future transfer prices. By developing custom metrics based on this information such as playing time, goal contribution, or age at the time of transfer the project aims to find the factors that influence transfer pricing and report trends within the player market. 

Objectives:
We are fans of soccer and would like to learn how to work with web scaping and perform data analysis in Python over the course of this class. This project is very flexible as we can scale it up to training a neural network that analyzes player stats to predict transfer prices, or scale it down to just scraping data and building a database to explore basic correlations. 

Dependencies:

Libraries: 
Numpy (data structures, and numerical operations) 
Pandas (data manipulation, analysis, and cleaning) 
sci-py (builds onto numpy with statistical testing, including Poisson distribution) 
scikit-learn (machine learning library for regression, classification, clustering, and model evaluation.) 
Soccerdata (Scrapes and formats soccer data from multiple sources) 
Statsbombpy (Official Python client for StatsBombâ€™s open data API) 
Mplsoccer (Visualization library for plotting soccer-specific graphics (pitches, pass maps, heatmaps, radar charts). 
ScraperFC (Scraper framework to pull football data from public websites) 
socceraction (mplements advanced soccer analytics frameworks like VAEP (Valuing Actions by Estimating Probabilities) and xT (Expected Threat).) 
soccer_xg (Toolkit for building expected goals (xG) models from event data)  
Kloppy(Normalizes and parses event and tracking data from multiple providers into a standard format.)  
Databallpy (Library for syncing tracking and event data into unified match timelines.) 
Pytorch  (deeplearning/neural nets framework) 

Datasets: Statsbomb, fbRef, Transfermarkt, understat, fotmod, whoScored
